# 02 Portfolio

## During our boot camp course, we were assigned a project aimed at helping us create a portfolio of our work that effectively showcases our skills and talents as web developers. The project focused on utilizing Flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables, allowing us to practice and strengthen our newly acquired skills while creating web applications that can be deployed and used during our job search.

My motivation to complete this project stemmed from the desire to refine my CSS and HTML coding abilities from scratch and to construct a portfolio that effectively demonstrates my talents and skills as a budding web developer. Ultimately, my goal is to enhance my prospects for success by having multiple deployed web applications to present to potential employers.

The project addresses the problem of students needing to showcase their abilities and attract the attention of prospective employers. By creating and deploying web applications, we can provide tangible evidence of our skills and exhibit our thought processes and problem-solving capabilities. This significantly enhances our employability and increases the likelihood of receiving initial interviews at companies that place importance on reviewing a portfolio of work.

Throughout the project, I have learned invaluable skills in web development, including the effective use of Flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Additionally, I have gained practical experience in constructing responsive and visually appealing web applications. I understand the significance of having multiple deployed projects in my portfolio, as it sets me apart in the highly competitive job market. This project has given me a comprehensive understanding of how to present my work effectively, highlighting my strengths to potential employers and maximizing my chances of securing desirable opportunities.
