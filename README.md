# 02 Portfolio

## This assignment was assigned during our boot camp course to allow students to practice refactoring lines of code and adhere to best practices, aiming to leave the code in a cleaner and more organized state than initially given. The project revolved around HTML and CSS, challenging my understanding of these languages and allowing me to enhance my problem-solving skills. It also allowed me to seek assistance or ask questions whenever I encountered difficulties.

   My motivation behind undertaking this project was to improve my skills in code refactoring, specifically in the context of HTML and CSS. I wanted to enhance my ability to write clean, organized, and maintainable code, which is crucial in professional software development.

   Although this project was assigned as homework, my motivation to build it was driven by the desire to consolidate my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. By actively engaging in refactoring, I aimed to solidify my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in improving code quality.

   The primary problem that this project solves is the presence of poorly structured or messy code. Refactoring and organizing the code according to best practices enhances readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other developers. It also improves the overall efficiency of the code, making it easier to identify and fix bugs or add new features in the future.

   Through this project, I gained valuable insights and learning experiences. I deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS syntax and their respective best practices. Refactoring the code allowed me to explore ways to improve code readability and maintainability. Additionally, I became familiar with using Git and GitHub for version control, enabling me to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage code repositories effectively. Overall, this project broadened my knowledge and skills in web development, refining my ability to write clean and well-structured code.
